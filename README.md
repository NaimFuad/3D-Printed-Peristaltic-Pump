Status - Work In Progress

The main idea of this project is to allow user to 3D print their own peristaltic pump. The pump able to micro dose liquid and the design allows it to self prime and avoid from bleeding.

An extension of this project can be applied to agricultural field where precise chemical might need to be introduce to plant from time to time.
